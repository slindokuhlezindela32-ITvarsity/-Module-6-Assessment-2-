        <h3>FORD</h3>

        <p>The Ford Motor Company, commonly known as Ford, is an American multinational automaker that has its main headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. </p>
        
        <h4>FORD SEAT AND STEERING</h4>
        
        <img src="images/inside%20view%20ford.jpg">

        <p>Heated/Cooled seats for both driver and passengers are available as an option on most vehicles. There are three different heat settings; you easily set them via push button switches that control the left and right heated seats, and a red light illuminates to show the heat level setting you’ve chosen. Whether it’s a frosty morning, a chilly day, or a freezing cold night, a heated steering wheel is also guaranteed to warm your hands better than a pair of gloves.</p>
        
        <h4>FORD DESIGN</h4>

        <p>The downside to this wonderfully packaged piece of design? “Our targets didn’t include things like luggage. It didn’t include creature comforts. Other supercar manufacturers might have weekend bags, or golf clubs, we didn’t have those kind of targets.”</p>
